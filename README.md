# Dashtoon assignment

In order run the code, upload a reference image by naming it as "reference.jpeg" and a content image, naming it as "content.jpeg" in the same directory. After the upload is complete run all the cells of Assignment.ipynb in the given order. The code will change the content image in the style of reference image and will save an outcome image by the name of "Outcome.jpeg" in the same directory. I have also saved some of the reference images, content image and outcomes in the exp folders.
