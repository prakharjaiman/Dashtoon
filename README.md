# Dashtoon assignment

In order run the code, upload a style image and write its file path in the "style_image_path" variable and a content image under the "content_image_url" variable. After the upload is complete run all the cells of Assignment.ipynb in the given order. The code will change the content image in the style of style image and will save an outcome image by the name of "Stylized_image.jpg" in the same directory. I have also saved some of the style images, content image and outcomes in the exp folders.
